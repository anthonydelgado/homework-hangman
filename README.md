# MovieMan.JS 

MovieMan.JS is an example of a Hangman like javascript game that aggregates movie data from the Open Movie Database API. This app was built while attending Rutgers Coding Bootcamp!

In this hang man game I decided to pull movie titles from The Open Movie Database api  and then return the plot so you can guess the movie title. As the user types in the movie title we loop through all the letters in the Movie title and then fade in the correct letters. The user also gets $100 for each correct letter the enter and the total is displayed on the screen in real time.
